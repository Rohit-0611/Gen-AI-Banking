# GenAI-Based Banking Services for Customers
## Overview
GenAI Banking Services is an AI-powered system designed to provide enhanced banking services to customers. This project leverages the power of the Google Palm Large Language Model (LLM) that has been fine-tuned for the specific use case of banking services. Additionally, Langchain is utilized for prompt engineering, and the use of vector embeddings enhances the model's understanding of customer requests and queries.

## Features
Advanced Language Model: GenAI Banking Services is built upon the Google Palm Large Language Model (LLM), providing natural language understanding and generation capabilities tailored to banking services.

Fine-Tuning for Banking Use Cases: The model has been fine-tuned to understand and respond to various banking-related queries and tasks, ensuring accuracy and relevance.

Langchain Integration: Langchain, a powerful tool for prompt engineering, is incorporated to improve the model's performance in understanding user inputs.

Vector Embeddings: The project utilizes vector embeddings for a deeper understanding of customer requests and context.

Local Storage with FAISS: To optimize response times, vector embeddings are efficiently stored using FAISS, a similarity search library, providing fast and local access to the embeddings.

User-Friendly Interface: GenAI Banking Services comes with a user-friendly web interface powered by Streamlit, making it easy for customers to interact with the AI model.
